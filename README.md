# RTAdmin

## Introduction

This is a project dedicated for my summer internship under eRevMax Technologies, Pvt. Ltd. This is a basic CRUD app regarding hotels, where employees can add new hotels to their databases or update details of existing hotels using the CRUD app.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack involved in the project is:

- Frontend : React.js and CSS for styles
- Backend : CRUD API with express.js
- Database : Microsoft Access
- Environment : Microsoft Windows

## Functionalities

The functionalities of the web app include

- Login : The user can login, whose credentials are verified after comparing with the stored user credentials in the database
- Dashboard : After a user logs in successfully, they are redirected to the dashboard where they can see the tab to go to adding hotels and allow them to search entered hotels
- Hotel : In the hotel section, users can add a new hotel, or entered updated data for existing hotel to update their data in the database

## Todo (for me)

The remaining tasks in this project

- [ ] Styles (very important)
- [ ] Logout based on inactivity time (if possible)
- [ ] Fix the still weird behavior of the property code field, setting it to clear out the input when value is deselected.
